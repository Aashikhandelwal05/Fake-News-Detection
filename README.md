# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning

This project aims to detect **fake news** articles using both traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches. It is designed to identify misinformation in text and detect deepfake images and videos.

##  Features

- Fake News Detection using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Random Forest
 

-  Deepfake Image Detection (Coming soon)
-  Video Deepfake Detection (Planned)
-  Clean and responsive UI using Flask
